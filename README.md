# Fire and Gas Detection in Home Automation

The Fire and Gas Detection in Home Automation project aims to enhance safety and security in residential settings by integrating advanced sensors and automation technologies to detect and respond to fire and gas leaks effectively.

## Overview

Fires and gas leaks pose serious threats to homes and occupants. This project addresses these risks by implementing a comprehensive detection and alert system that leverages sensors, IoT devices, and automation techniques to detect anomalies and trigger appropriate responses in real-time.

## Features

- **Fire Detection:** Utilizes smoke and heat sensors to detect fire outbreaks.
- **Gas Leak Detection:** Incorporates gas sensors to identify leaks from appliances such as stoves and heaters.
- **Real-time Alerts:** Sends immediate notifications to homeowners and emergency services in case of detection.
- **Automation Response:** Triggers automated responses such as turning off gas valves and activating sprinkler systems.
- **Integration with Home Systems:** Seamlessly integrates with existing home automation systems for enhanced control and monitoring.

## Technologies Used

- **Sensor Technology:** Smoke sensors, heat sensors, gas sensors
- **IoT Devices:** Raspberry Pi, Arduino
- **Communication Protocols:** MQTT, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth
- **Automation Platforms:** Home Assistant, OpenHAB
- **Cloud Services:** AWS IoT, Google Cloud IoT
- **Programming Languages:** Python, C/C++
